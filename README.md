### 🌐 API + Web Integration

**What I'm exploring:**  
Adding online functionality to my KivyMD apps using Django REST framework and frontend tools.

**Why:**  
To sync results, enable cross-device use, and bring cloud power to local tools.

**Tech in Use:**  
Python, Django, REST APIs, HTML, CSS, JavaScript

**Examples in Progress:**
- Remote question bank sync for Shuffler
- Online matrix calculation history
- Auth and result export over the web

### 📊 Light Data Analysis Experience

Beyond app development, I’ve also worked with Python’s Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib libraries for basic data analysis. Projects included student grading analysis, performance charting, and structured reporting. These experiences helped sharpen my logical reasoning and ability to visualize data insights.

### 🛠 Upcoming Projects

**Structural Engineering Tools:**  
Currently working on tools for:
- Beam and slab design
- Structural load analysis
- Reinforcement detailing

Targeted for use by engineers and students seeking quick desktop tools for routine checks.

Stay tuned!
