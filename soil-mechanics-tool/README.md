## ðŸ“„ Soil Mechanics Software

**What it does:**  
Carries out essential geotechnical computations like bearing capacity, stress distribution, and earth pressure. Includes plots and allows result export.

**Why I built it:**  
To assist students and junior engineers with frequently used soil calculations, improving productivity and understanding.

**How it works:**  
Inputs are entered via KivyMD UI, and calculations follow standard civil engineering formulas. Outputs include formatted tables and matplotlib plots, which can be exported to Word.

**Technologies Used:**  
Python, KivyMD, Matplotlib, python-docx

**Features:**
- Multiple soil mechanics calculators
- Graph plotting with matplotlib
- Word export of results
